If you want to build the Mac OSX app do the following:

1. Get a copy of Platypus from here:
   http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus#download

   I've tested with 3.3 and 3.4.  3.3 doesn't work in the command line form, but
   3.4 does.

   After unpacking the zip file, open the Install Command Line Tool.app found in
   "Platypus 3.4/Command Line Tool".  This will install it in /usr/local/bin.

2. Configure CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to somewhere where you can install
   SCIRun.

   Run "make install".

3. For now you need to hand edit the buildApp.sh shell script to point to
   CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and SCIRUN_THIRDPARTY_DIR from your build directory.

4. Run "./buildApp.cc"
