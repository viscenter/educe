This is not a finished product, much of the gui isnt hooked up, but you
can load a nrrd (make it an 8 bit nrrd for now) and add rectangles to
the editor. I just wanted this committed so it is backed up with my
maching being flaky.  I like the docked editor dialog, try it out.

In order to run, you must have Python and PyQt, QT  installed. you must
turn on BUILD_SR_PY in cmake, and you must set the following env vars.

your builds on-the-fly-libs dir:
SCIRUN_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR=<full path to your
SCIRun/bin/on-the-fly-libs>

You must set your PYTHONPATH env var to your builds sr_py dir:
PYTHONPATH=<full path to your
SCIRun/bin/lib>mjc@cuervo /scratch/mjc/cibc/SCIRun/

cd to CIRun/src/StandAlone/Apps/BioImage

and type:

python main_app.py
