    <summary>Convert one Nrrd containing points and optionally another nrrd
containing connections to a SCIRun Mesh. This converter works on regular,
unstructured and structured meshes. If mesh points but no mesh connections
are given, a structured dataset will most likely be created (i.e. StructQuad,
StructHex).  If both mesh points and mesh connections are given, an
unstructured field will most likely be created (i.e. Curve, TriSurf, QuadSurf,
TetVol, HexVol).</summary>
