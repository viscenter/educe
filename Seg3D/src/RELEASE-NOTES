RELEASE NOTES

Program: SCIRun 4.0 (BETA 1)
Date: 08-08-2008

Note:

This is the first SCIRun 4.0 beta version. This one is for testing purposes
only, as not all functions are supported yet.


Release cycle:

SCIRun 4.0 is distrubuted in a different fashion in comparison to previous
SCIRun releases. We will be updating and releasing new SCIRun binaries twice a 
month to improve feedback to the users of our binary release. With each binary
release we will also release new tar/zip files with the code, for people who
want to contribute to the development of SCIRun.

These intermediate releases are intented to quickly ship bug fixes and new 
features without too much delays.


Supported platforms:
[1] Windows: SCIRun 4.0 currently runs on both Windows Vista and Windows XP. 
Currently only 32bit version is available, but a 64bit version is under 
development. Please upgrade to the latest service packs of both Vista or XP
before installing SCIRun. 

[2] OSX: SCIRun 4.0 supports both OSX 10.4.9 and higher and OSX 10.5.4 and higher.
Currently both a 32bit and a 64bit version are available. The 64bit version is
only available for OSX 10.5.

[3] Linux: SCIRun 4.0 supports most flavors of Linux, but requires the user to
compile SCIRun from scratch. Generally, ATI graphics cards do not work with 
SCIRun on Linux, for functionality such as volume rendering. For Linux we 
recommend an NVDIA graphics card, as the NVDIA drivers show a better compatiblity
with SCIRun.


Binary versions:

[1] Binary versions are available for Windows XP, Windows Vista, OS X 10.4, and 
OS X 10.5.


Source code:

[1] Source code of SCIRun is available from https://code.sci.utah.edu/, use svn
to checkout the latest version of the code. The latest code can be downloaded by:

svn co https://code.sci.utah.edu/svn/SCIRun/cibc/trunk/ .


Limitations of this beta version:

[1] Currently a few modules are not yet available in the binary version:
     EvalutateLinAlgGeneral, GenerateSrtreamLinesHeuristic, RemoveHexSheet, and
     InsertHexVolSheetAlongSurface, and CollectPointClouds

[2] We have upgraded all the modules that take in code to evaluate functions.
    Please check the documentation of the modules to upgrade the functions.
    For example the module CalculateFieldDataCompiled needs to be replaced by
    CalaculateFieldData. We are working on a better conversion from old networks
    but that is not yet available in the beta version

[3] Insight Package is not available in SCIRun 4.0. Due to many issues with this
    package it will not be available in this version. Better and improved ITK
    support will follow later in SCIRun 4.1.
    

Documentation:

[1] Currently only documentation of the old SCIRun version is available and is
available for guidance in this new SCIRun version. As we are developing a new
documentation system for our software, new tutorials and instructional movies
will become available this fall. We apologize for not having up to date 
documentation at this point. Questions regarding SCIRun can always be posted
to scirun-users@sci.utah.edu and we will be organizing works at the start of
winter season to teach SCIRun.


Known bugs:
[1] 2D Colormap editor crashes SCIRun when it is deleted.

[2] GenerateStreamLines currently only works for the cell walking, the integrating
    methods need to be fixed.
    


New features:

[1] Binary release for Windows and OSX. Dynamic compilation has been removed from
    most of SCIRun, allow the distribution of binary versions.

[2] Full 64bit support for Matrices and Fields, so both can be larger than 2Gb.
    Internally the 64bit version of SCIRun now use 64bit indices to support
    ever growing models.
    
[3] Support for periodic FE models, support for floating electrodes. New modules
    are available to insert knowns into the FE matrix system and to merge the FE
    equations at the boundaries of a domain.
    
[4] Added support for Leopard, and Leopard 64bit. OSX Leopard is now properly 
    supported by SCIRun.
    
[5] Added module for importing environment variables into SCIRun.

[6] Added support for specifying environment variables on the command line, e.g.
    specify +VAR=value on the commandline to set VAR to value.

[7] Removed dynamic compilation, so SCIRun does not require a compiler anymore.

[8] Simplified Volume Rendering pipeline: new FieldToTextureConverter will 
    generate 2D histogram automatically.

[9] Modules do not generate mapping matrix if it is not needed. If a matrix 
    output port is not connected the ampping matrix will not be generated in the
    newer modules, to safe memory     

[10] Precompiling tables will now be done in parallel, to improve efficiency.
     Field data types rely heavily on precompiling tables to speed up geometry
     computations. These computations are now done in parallel to improve
     performance on multi-core architechtures .
     
[11] Internally most function calls are now virtual so modules work on a wider
     range of mesh types and field types. Instead using the class name of a 
     field to select whether an algorithm will work, we use the properties. 
     Allow modules to work more broadly. 
     
[12] Modules like SetFieldData will do automatically a conversion of basis type
     as well as data type, allowing pipes to be connected more flexibly.

[13] Most modules will do an automatic unstructure of the data if needed to
     make it easier for the user to like up modules.
     
[14] Modules now report errors more thoroughly. Connecting a wrong input will
     not cause SCIRun to crash anymore.
     
[15] The SCIRun look has been upgraded to look more modern. All GUIs have been
     updated. 
     
[16] Modules in the editor look smaller to support a better overview of what is
     going on in a module.
     
[17] The network editor now supports editing networks while running a network.

[18] Added a new smaller network overview is added to the lower part of the
     network editor.

[19] All the menus of the ViewScene module have been upgraded to be better
     accessible and usability.
     
[20] Improved the box widget, it is easier now to rotate this widget and to 
     restrict its movements.
     
[21] Upgrade of parsed code. Code is no longer parsed through the compiler, but
     a parser designed for fast performance was integrated, which run in parallel
     and outperforms the old dynamically compiled versions.
